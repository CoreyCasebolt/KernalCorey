# Wazuh Baseline

## Purpose

Before installing any agents or creating alerts, I documented the clean state of my Wazuh deployment.

This helps me:

- See what changes after agents are installed
- Compare before and after system behavior
- Keep my lab organized as it grows

---

## What Was Verified

- Wazuh Manager is running
- Wazuh Indexer is running
- Dashboard is accessible
- No endpoint agents are installed yet

---

## Screenshots Included

- Dashboard home page
- Agent list (empty state)
- Manager service status
- Indexer service status

This represents the starting point of my SIEM setup before endpoint integration.
